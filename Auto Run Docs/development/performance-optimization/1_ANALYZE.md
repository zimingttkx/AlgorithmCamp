# Performance Analysis - Codebase Survey

## Context
- **Playbook:** Performance
- **Agent:** {{AGENT_NAME}}
- **Project:** {{AGENT_PATH}}
- **Auto Run Folder:** {{AUTORUN_FOLDER}}
- **Loop:** {{LOOP_NUMBER}}

## Objective

Analyze the codebase to identify **categories of potential performance issues** and create a game plan for systematic investigation. This document drives the discovery phase - finding WHERE to look for performance problems.

## Instructions

1. **Survey the codebase structure** - Identify the main directories, frameworks used, and architecture patterns
2. **Identify performance-sensitive areas** based on:
   - UI rendering (if applicable)
   - Data processing (large collections, frequent transformations)
   - Network/IO operations
   - State management patterns
   - Event handling
   - Memory-intensive operations
3. **Output a tactical game plan** to `{{AUTORUN_FOLDER}}/LOOP_{{LOOP_NUMBER}}_GAME_PLAN.md`

## Analysis Checklist

- [ ] **Survey codebase (if needed)**: First check if `{{AUTORUN_FOLDER}}/LOOP_{{LOOP_NUMBER}}_GAME_PLAN.md` already exists with at least one tactic defined. If it does, skip the survey and mark this task complete—the game plan is already in place. If it doesn't exist, examine project structure, identify framework(s) and language(s) used, find main entry points and largest files. Note any performance-related libraries or patterns already in use.

## Output Format

Create/update `{{AUTORUN_FOLDER}}/LOOP_{{LOOP_NUMBER}}_GAME_PLAN.md` with the following structure:

```markdown
# Performance Game Plan

## Codebase Profile
- **Language/Framework:** [e.g., Python/Django, TypeScript/Node, Go, etc.]
- **Size:** [Approximate LOC or file count]
- **Key Directories:** [List main source directories]
- **Performance Libraries:** [Any existing perf tools, caching, profiling, etc.]

## Investigation Tactics

Each tactic is a specific, actionable search pattern for finding performance issues.

### Tactic 1: [Name]
- **Target:** [What type of issue this finds]
- **Search Pattern:** [Specific grep/glob patterns or code patterns to look for]
- **Files to Check:** [Specific files or glob patterns]
- **Why It Matters:** [Brief explanation of performance impact]

### Tactic 2: [Name]
...
```

## Tactic Categories to Consider

When creating tactics, consider these common performance issue categories:

### Algorithmic Complexity
- O(n²) or worse algorithms in hot paths
- Repeated searches through unsorted data
- Unnecessary sorting or re-computation
- Suboptimal data structures for the access pattern

### Memory Usage
- Unbounded collection growth
- Memory leaks from unclosed resources
- Large object allocations in loops
- Missing cleanup of temporary data

### I/O Operations
- Synchronous I/O in performance-critical paths
- N+1 query patterns (database or API)
- Missing caching for repeated reads
- Inefficient batch sizes

### Concurrency
- Lock contention in hot paths
- Unnecessary serialization
- Missing parallelization opportunities
- Thread pool exhaustion

### Network & External Services
- Redundant API calls
- Missing request batching
- No timeout handling
- Unbounded retry loops

### Rendering & UI (if applicable)
- Expensive computations in render loops
- Unnecessary re-renders or repaints
- Missing virtualization for long lists
- Unoptimized event handlers

## Guidelines

- **Be specific**: Each tactic should have concrete search patterns
- **Prioritize**: Order tactics by likely impact (biggest wins first)
- **Be realistic**: Focus on issues that are actually fixable with reasonable effort
- **No implementation**: This phase is discovery only - find WHERE to look, not WHAT to fix
